Wunderground API Mobile App
This application takes an API key and makes two asynchronous ajax requests to retrieve an hourly forecast for 10 hours in the future. This is set up to run on a mobile phone, as well. Simply navigate to https://cs.drexel.edu/~dcl67/CS275/webApp2/dcl67_hw2.html, enter your API key, and hit enter. The list of forecasts will populate, displaying time, temperature, conditions, and an image of the conditions. Again, this can be run in both a desktop and mobile environment, but note the mobile header and footer, utilized from the jquery mobile libraries.
