To access the file through the server, run:
$ node server.js

Do NOT simply click on the html file and run it in a browser.

The purpose of this lab is to interact with a MySQL database through a client-facing interface that also interacts with a node.js server. The database is for students, courses, and the student grades per courses. There are three pages: one that allows you to view each of the three tables, one to generate a student's transcript per their name, info, classes taken, and grades, and another page that allows you to add a student into the database directly through the interface. 

Note that there are also dropdowns to prevent errors in the SQL syntax collected symbolically through the webpage interface.
