	A simple HTML webpage containing a brief description of Fibonacci numbers, borrowed from Wikipedia (see included hyperlink). The page has a text input field, a button, and a table that expands to show Fibonacci calculations. 
	To view this webpage, open your favorite web browser and go to https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~dcl67/CS265/webApp1/dcl67_HW1.html. To calculate a Fibonacci sequence of n terms, enter a POSITIVE NON-NEGATIVE INTEGER in the text field and press the submit button. Your table will populate below to however many terms you specify. Note that there is no limit to this, which could provide you with some potentially large tables. Also note that the table will output scientific notation after larger Fibonacci calculations.
